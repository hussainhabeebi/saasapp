# Leadvyne — self-provisioning setup (option B)

Front-end (login-gated) → onboard workflow → **creates and activates a dedicated bot workflow
per client via the n8n API** → returns the Chatwoot webhook URL. Each client gets a thin wrapper
that calls one shared engine. Fix logic once in the engine; clients never drift.

```
frontend/index.html ──POST──► n8n: onboard.json
                                  │ checks passcode
                                  │ writes clients-table row  (NocoDB master)
                                  │ POST /api/v1/workflows     (creates wrapper)
                                  │ POST .../activate
                                  └ returns webhook_url
wrapper (per client) ── Execute Workflow ──► engine.json (shared logic: text/voice/image)
followup-template.json  → clone per client for scheduled nudges
```

## 1. CLIENTS config table (NocoDB control plane)
One table holding every client's config. Read with your **master** NocoDB token.

| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| client_name | Single line |
| chatwoot_account_id | Single line |
| chatwoot_inbox_id | Single line |
| chatwoot_base | Single line |
| chatwoot_token | Single line |
| nocodb_base | Single line |
| leads_table_id | Single line |
| nocodb_token | Single line |
| openrouter_key | Single line |
| model | Single line |
| language | Single line |
| main_prompt | Long text |
| flow_json | Long text |
| followup_count | Number |
| followup_hours | Single line |
| followup_messages | Long text |
| active | Single line |
| quote_template | Long text |
| quote_terms | Long text |
| quote_validity_days | Number |
| quote_logo_url | Long text (base64 data URI of the uploaded logo) |
| waba_id | Single line (WhatsApp Business Account ID — for template list/create, separate from wa_phone_id) |
| prospect_gsheet_url | Single line (last-used Prospects import sheet link, remembered across logins) |
| authentik_email | Single line (email of the Authentik user allowed to log into this client's dashboard) |

### LEADS table additions (for the Quotation module's sent log)
Two more columns on the **LEADS** table (not CLIENTS) so sent quotations show up in the
Quotation tab's "Sent Quotations" report:

| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| QuoteSentAt | Single line (ISO datetime) |
| QuoteSentTotal | Single line |

### Prospects module
Uses existing LEADS columns only — no new schema. Imported contacts are created with
`Stage: "prospect"` and `Tags: "Prospect"`, and get promoted like any other lead once they
reply and progress through your normal pipeline stages.

Requires two things already used elsewhere in this repo:
- `wa_token` / `waba_id` on the CLIENTS row — a Meta System User token with
  `whatsapp_business_management` permission, used **directly from the browser** (same pattern
  as the existing WhatsApp reply feature) to list/create WhatsApp message templates via
  `https://graph.facebook.com/v18.0/{waba_id}/message_templates`. New templates need Meta's
  approval (minutes to a day) before they're usable.
- The same Google Sheets service-account credential already used by the GSheet Sync workflow
  (`REPLACE_GSHEET_CRED`) — the client's prospect sheet must be shared with that service
  account's email, and have `Name` and `Phone` header columns.

Import **n8n/prospects-import.json** (webhook path `leadvyne-prospects-import`) alongside your
other workflows — same NocoDB/Chatwoot credentials as `broadcast.json`. Each webhook call
imports up to 50 new (not-yet-seen) phone numbers from the sheet, creates them as `prospect`
leads, and sends each one the chosen approved template via a freshly created Chatwoot
conversation — so first-touch outbound still goes through the Chatwoot channel, and the
conversation is fully visible in your Chatwoot inbox and linked to the lead from message one.

## 2. Create the n8n API key + credential
1. In n8n: **Settings → n8n API → Create API key**. Copy it.
2. **Credentials → New → Header Auth**, name it **n8n API**, header name `X-N8N-API-KEY`,
   value = the key. (This is the "API I will provide in config".)
   The key lives only here — never in the front-end, never shared.

## 3. Import workflows (in this order)
1. **engine.json** — set the 3 `REPLACE_CONTROL_*` placeholders (clients table) + master NocoDB
   credential. Save. **Copy its workflow id** from the URL.
2. **onboard.json** —
   - `Set · Settings`: `REPLACE_PASSCODE` (your access passcode), `REPLACE_ENGINE_WORKFLOW_ID`
     (the engine id from step 1). n8n_base is already `https://n8n.aiautomationsuae.com`.
   - `NocoDB · Create client`: clients-table ids + master credential.
   - `HTTP · Create workflow` and `HTTP · Activate workflow`: select the **n8n API** credential.
   - Activate the workflow.
3. **followup-template.json** — clone per client for nudges (low volume; per-client is fine).

## 4. Deploy the front-end
It's a static site. On Coolify: new app → this repo → it uses the `Dockerfile` (nginx) to serve
`frontend/`. Or open `frontend/index.html` locally. The onboard endpoint defaults to
`https://n8n.aiautomationsuae.com/webhook/leadvyne-onboard`.

## 5. Use it
Open the page → enter the **passcode** → fill the form → **Provision client**. It writes the
config, creates + activates that client's workflow, and shows the webhook URL. Paste that URL
into the client's Chatwoot inbox (**Configuration → Webhooks**, event **Message created**).

## Security notes
- The passcode is checked server-side in the onboard workflow; the page only collects it.
  For stronger protection, also put Coolify Basic Auth in front of the static site.
- Tokens entered in the form are sent to your onboard webhook over HTTPS and stored in your
  NocoDB. The n8n API key never touches the browser.
- Set the onboard webhook CORS (already `*` in the JSON) to your page origin once it's hosted.

## Dashboard login (Authentik, OIDC)
Login is delegated to a self-hosted Authentik instance instead of the old client-side
`client_name`/`dashboard_password` comparison — that comparison ran entirely in the browser
against a record fetched with a shared token, so any visitor could read every client's row
(passwords, Chatwoot/Meta tokens, everything) via devtools. Authentik replaces that with a
real Authorization Code + PKCE OIDC flow (no client secret — `dashboard.html` is a public SPA
with nowhere safe to store one).

**One-time Authentik setup** (already done for this deploy, keep for reference / new environments):
1. Deploy Authentik via Coolify's one-click service (needs its own Postgres + Redis).
2. Create an **Application** → **OAuth2/OpenID Provider**:
   - Client type: **Public**
   - Redirect URI: the dashboard's own URL (e.g. `https://app.leadvyne.com/dashboard.html`)
   - Authorization flow: `default-provider-authorization-implicit-consent` (skips the "this app
     wants access" consent screen — this is a first-party app, not a third-party integration)
3. Copy the generated **Client ID** into `dashboard.html`'s `CONFIG.AUTHENTIK_BASE` /
   `AUTHENTIK_CLIENT_ID` / `AUTHENTIK_REDIRECT_URI`.

**Per-client mapping — this is the part that needs doing for every client:**
Authentik only proves *who* logged in (their email); it has no concept of "Leadvyne clients."
After a successful login, the dashboard looks up the CLIENTS row whose `authentik_email`
field matches the email in Authentik's ID token. So onboarding a new client now means two
separate steps:
1. Create their CLIENTS row (as before — onboarding workflow or manually).
2. In Authentik → **Directory → Users → Create**, make a user with that client's email, and
   set that same email in the `authentik_email` field on their CLIENTS row.
   No matching Authentik user + `authentik_email` = they can't log in, even with a valid
   Authentik account.

**Known gap**: the self-serve "Get Started" signup wizard in `dashboard.html` still collects a
`dashboard_password` and creates the CLIENTS row via the onboard workflow, but that password is
no longer used for login — the wizard auto-signs the user in for that one browser session using
the onboard response directly. For them to log back in later, an admin still has to manually
create their Authentik user and set `authentik_email`, same as any other client. Automating that
(via Authentik's own API) is a reasonable follow-up, not done here.

## Per-client customization (Mix 1)
- **Config** — edit that client's row (flow, prompt, follow-ups). No workflow edit.
- **Wrapper** — open that client's generated workflow; add nodes around `Run engine`
  (there's a comment marking where). Isolated to that client.
- **Custom logic** — give the engine a `custom_subworkflow_id` branch for a one-off client.
- Never hardcode a client inside the shared engine — keep it generic and config-driven.

## Tuning
- `engine.json` is a working foundation — test each media branch once; Chatwoot attachment
  field names vary slightly by channel. WhatsApp voice is ogg/opus; swap the transcribe node
  for your STT if needed.
- Confirm the n8n API response shape for the created workflow id (`id` vs `data.id`) — the
  activate node handles both.

## Recovery / win-back engine (backend/recovery.js)
A standalone scheduled service (does not touch `engine.json` or `nba.js`) that nudges silent
leads with an escalating 3-step drip: soft check-in → nurture → last-chance win-back. Runs
hourly, reads the clients table read-only, and only writes to new `recovery_*` fields on the
leads table (auto-created on first run) — it never writes `Stage`, `ConvHistory`, or `LastMsgAt`.

- If a client has the classic `followup_count` sequence configured (followup-template.json),
  this engine waits until that sequence is exhausted before starting its own ladder, so a lead
  is never double-messaged by both systems.
- Skips leads that are terminal (`Converted`/`Lost`/`Closed`/`Opt Out`), opted out, or currently
  `Handover`'d to a human agent.
- Escalation timing and copy are configurable per client (all optional — sane defaults apply if
  left blank) via new columns on the **CLIENTS** table:

  | Field | Type | Meaning |
  |---|---|---|
  | recovery_enabled | Single line ("Yes"/"No") | Set "No" to disable the ladder for this client |
  | recovery_gaps_hours | Single line, e.g. `6,48,168` | Hours-since-previous-step before each of the 3 stages fires |
  | recovery_messages | Long text, 3 lines | One message template per stage; `{name}` is replaced with the lead's name |
  | recovery_templates | Long text, up to 3 lines | Optional: approved WhatsApp template name per stage, for use once the 24h session window has closed (leave blank to send plain text) |
  | recovery_template_lang | Single line | Template language code (defaults to the client's `language`) |

- Deploy as its own container: `docker compose up -d leadvyne-recovery` (see
  `backend/docker-compose.yml`). Test a single run with `RUN_NOW=1`.
- Uses the same `NOCODB_TOKEN`/`CLIENTS_TABLE` as `nba.js`; no new credentials needed.
